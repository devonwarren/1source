        <p><strong>Why are you being asked to complete this form?</strong></p>

        <p>
            Because we do business with the government, we must reach out to, hire, and provide equal opportunity to qualified people with disabilities.<sup><a href="#i">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</a></sup> To help us measure how well we are doing, we are asking you to tell us if you have a disability or if you ever had a disability. Completing this form is voluntary, but we hope that you will choose to fill it out. If you are applying for a job, any answer you give will be kept private and will not be used against you in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you already work for us, your answer will not be used against you in any way. Because a person may become disabled at any time, we are required to ask all of our employees to update their information every five years. You may voluntarily self-identify as having a disability on this form without fear of any punishment because you did not identify as having a disability earlier.
        </p>

        <p><strong>How do I know if I have a disability?</strong></p>

        <p>
            You are considered to have a disability if you have a physical or mental impairment or medical condition that substantially limits a major life activity, or if you have a history or record of such an impairment or medical condition.
